# Grommet full project

This is a demo of a business dashboard wired through to (imaginary, but
modelled) hardware underneath, so we can demo the link between increased
load on the business and spinning up new VMs and hardware underneath.

To run this application, execute the following commands:

  1. Install NPM modules

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

  2. Start the development server:

    ```
    $ gulp dev
    ```

  3. Create the app distribution to be used by the back-end server

    ```
    $ gulp dist
    ```
